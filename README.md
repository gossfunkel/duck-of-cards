# Duck of Cards
silly little idle tower defence game, with an eccentric Duke Duck of Cards who dispenses your upgrades in the form of magical playing cards

### TODO:
- BUGFIX: arrows fly while paused / various animation cancels (fast spinning duck). n.b. pausing at the wrong time causes hundreds of dogs to spawn (!!)
- add proper logging

#### PHASE 1) Basic game mechanics
- improve card menu and add more cards
- add more enemies and bigger waves
- add more card options and do nicer card art 
- add more tower types (magic,fire,ranger,bomb,poison)
- give towers more prioritising options (furthest forward, closest, highest hp etc)
- make enemies 'pop' (coin scatter animation?) and improve tile placement (animation, sfx)
- confine mouse to window edges and move the camera when it hits an edge
- procedurally generate paths and have enemies follow path? or add more interesting pathfinding
- wave splashscreen/nice HUD texture

#### PHASE 2) Story & progression
- add in all dialogue & character sprites
- improve pause menu and add save/load functionality (steam cloud sync?)
- make and add some music!
- implement missions (only a few, for the main story sections)
- improve progression display and splashes/notifiers for mission/wave progress
- add more terrain/some random plant sprites
- update enemy, tower, and castle models
- add pond and wandering ducks
- make 'springy' buttons and icons (give UI elements conservable momentum)
- make Steam page and promo videos

#### PHASE 3) Ending & finishing touches
- procedural spawning of walls and building models between towers and castle
- 'evil mode' game state transition, general colour management and filtering shaders
- game menu, splash screen, and loading screens
- particle atmosphere: random leaves, dots, streaks, rain etc
- fill out assets:
 -> enemies
 -> allies
 -> buildings
 -> music
 -> sfx
 -> fx/animations/effect shaders
 -> set dressing / props
 -> card art
 -> buttons/menu textures
- distribution build
